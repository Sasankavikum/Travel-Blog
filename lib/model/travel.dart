      Travel('Nine Arch', 'Ella', 'assets/images/ella.jpg',
          'Built at 3100m above sea level, among the craggy peaks of the Central Highlands; the Nine Arches forms a viaduct between the Demodara and Ella Railway stations. Built entirely out of brick, rock and cement; without a single piece of steel; the bridge has stood solid from 1921, its time of creation.\nAccording to history, the bridge was built by the locals using such materials; when the construction came to a standstill from the lack of steel caused by World War I. But, in addition to this history; lore abounds the creation of the bridge. The most famous story speaks of a man named P. K. Appuhami, who lived in the Kappatipola area in Melimada. Born in 1870, Appuhami was a famed traditional drummer and devil dancer (a ritual dance form). \nOne day, while returning home gloomily as he lost a competition, Appuhami was seen by a British official. The man was extremely frightened by the devilish apparition (Appuhami was still in his dance costume) at the beginning; but soon became quite friendly. Learning that the strange foreigner was in his area to construct a railway; Appuhami assisted by supplying him with labour from the local villages.But things did not go smoothly with the railway construction. They found that they were unable to bridge a large gap between two hills; as there was a quagmire in the valley in between. It was not possible to create firm anchoring, due to the marshy ground. \nOn learning this, Appuhami requested to take over the bridge project. While he was rejected initially, they agreed later; as he had gained their trust with his assistance and friendship. As the story goes, Appuhami started working on the bridge in 1913. He solved the issue of the unstable ground by toppling giant rocks into the space; until a firm bed of rocks was formed. He then created the bridge’s brick columns over this bed and continued with the construction of the bridge. The methods of constructions used by Appuhami proved to be so intuitive and cost effective; that he finished the entire project, which was intended to continue for many years, within a single year at a fraction of the original cost planned. \nThe British officials were so shocked that the ‘savages’ had finished such a huge project so easily; that they refused to believe its structural integrity. At this point Appuhami is said to have sworn to the strength of the structure by saying he would prove it by lying under the bridge; when the railway line was used for the first time.'),
      Travel('Sigiriya Rock', 'Sigiriya', 'assets/images/sigiriya.jpg',
          "Sigiriya is one of Sri Lanka’s most popular tourist attractions and with good reason. This ruined, fifth century city has some extraordinary features, including moat and wall fortifications, elaborately landscaped gardens, and a monastery. But it is the two-hundred metre high granite rock that stands out from these ruins that is undoubtedly the star attraction, with its exquisite frescoes and the remains of a royal palace on the summit. I was looking forward to seeing the frescoes at Sigiriya after seeing images of them. However, I had not seen images of the stairs that tourists must ascend to see the paintings. Unfortunately, I have an unreasonable fear of heights, which isn't always a good thing for an ancient art archaeologist. I should add that because of that concern, I have never skipped a sight or been unable to take or film photographs up close. There have been a couple moments when it came really close! You walk past the ruins of a once-beautiful planted garden – complete with lakes and terraces – on your way to Lion Rock. A two-hundred-meter-high granite monolith looms ahead of the trail. My heart pumped louder and quicker with each stride. The ascent begins with a brick stairway at the bottom of the stairs and then transitions to an iron staircase built into the side of the granite rock face. It didn't help that there were swarms of people mounting the steps ahead of me — acrophobia is, after all, an illogical fear. In retrospect, the climb did not appear to be particularly difficult, but I recall being relieved when it was over. Climbing Sigiriya Rock was one of my most memorable archaeological visits because of the delicately painted frescoes and the amazing wall of graffiti, some of which had been left by Buddhist monks in the seventh and eighth centuries, and then walking among the amazing ruins of the royal palace on the flat topped outcrop (not too close to the edge, of course)."),

According to Siam's tradition, the Buddha left the print of his left foot on Adam's Peak and then walked over to Siam (now Thailand) in one stride, leaving the impression of his right foot. It's called Phra Sat, and it's intended to look like the footprint on Adam's Peak and be around the same size. Broad stairs go up to this walled enclosure with a tower-like structure atop the rock. The area marked off as containing the Buddha's foot impression is approximately five feet seven inches long and two feet seven inches wide. The Buddha's right foot is claimed to be imprinted in a hole in the rock in Thailand, which is roughly five feet long and two feet wide. Buddhists credit the Buddha's global size to the fact that he was roughly 35 feet tall, according to popular belief. The true footprint on Adam's Peak is said to be hidden beneath the visible granite in jewels, and Hindus believe it is that of the deity Siva. The rock's Tamil name (Civan-oli-pata) translates to 'the mountain road of Siva's light.' Muslims think the imprint belongs to Adam (hence the name Adam's Peak), whereas Christians believe it belongs to St. Thomas, Jesus' disciple. A shrine beside the rock has images of the God Saman, one of which is made of silver, and a Brahmin priest officiates at the shrine.

It is found in Sri Lanka's north central province. UNESCO designated Polonnaruwa as a World Heritage Site in 1982 under the name Historic City of Polonnaruwa due to its archeological importance and ancient technical supremacy. King Vijayabahu established Polonnaruwa as the first capital city after defeating Chola invaders in 1070 and reuniting the country under a native ruler. During the reign of the great King Parakramabahu, who reigned from 1153 to 1186, the nation achieved such heroic heights in rice production by building a gigantic irrigation network with reservoirs that resemble natural land seas. The remnants of the great kingdom of the Great King Parakramabahu may be found in Polonnaruwa. This kingdom's wealth and opulence are still visible. Today, the old city of Polonnaruwa is one of the country's best-planned archaeological relic sites, bearing witness to the Kingdom's early kings' discipline and magnificence. The Golden Age of Polonnaruwa was during the reign of King Parakramabahu. Under the patronage of the monarch, trade and agriculture prospered, as he was insistent that no drop of water coming from the skies be wasted, but rather utilised for the growth of the country. As a result, irrigation systems substantially better to those of the Anuradhapura period were built during Parakramabahu's reign, systems that still supply the water required for paddy farming in the country's east throughout the hot dry season.

It was decreed that whomever shelters and guards the Buddha Relic in this sanctuary of refuge is immediately given the right to control the land. The object is a powerful emblem of Sinhalese pride and identity.

Among the other gold-on-blue sculptures, the seventy-foot-high bubble-shaped pagoda sticks out. The stupa was also built in three months, which was a pleasant surprise."),

          "The famed Sorabora Wewa, a historic Bintanne irrigation reservoir, is located approximately 1 km from Mahiyangana town and is a must-see for tourists visiting Mahiyangana Rajmaha Viharaya. Sorabora Wewa, also known as the Sea of Binthanne in ancient times, is unique among ancient reservoirs in that it is the only one that does not employ a Bisokotuwa, which is the heart of all other significant reservoirs in the country. Since the 4th century BC, this ground-breaking technology has been the sole factor that has allowed the ancients to construct huge reservoirs. The sluice gates for the Sorabora Wewa were not placed on the embankment; instead, they were carved into a strategically situated natural rock away from the embankment and utilized as the sluice for the tank. The ancient builders opted to forego the tried and true Bisokotuwa for this construction since the rock was not vulnerable to erosion by water pressure. The Sorabora Tank is a 1590-foot (485-meter) embankment that dams the Diyawant to Oya. At maximum capacity, the tank covers 1100 acres (4.5 square kilometers) and stores 11800 acre feet (14.6 million square meters) of water. The slicing gates are around 5 feet wide and neatly carved into the natural granite."),
